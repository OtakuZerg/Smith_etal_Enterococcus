# Microbial Cooperation Enhances *Clostridioides difficile* Pathogenesis

### Abstract

*Clostridioides difficile* is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens and a global public health threat. Upon colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, *C. difficile* is exposed to a rapidly changing polymicrobial environment. The impact of cooperative interactions between the microbiota and *C. difficile* on the outcome of infection is largely unknown. Here, we show that microbial cooperation between *C. difficile* and commensal and pathogenic strains of Enterococcus has a profound impact on the growth, metabolism, and pathogenesis of *C. difficile*. Through a process of nutrient restriction and metabolite cross-feeding, enterococci shape the metabolic environment in the gut to enhance *C. difficile* fitness and increase toxin production. These findings demonstrate that members of the microbiota, such as *Enterococcus*, have a previously unappreciated impact on *C. difficile* behavior and virulence.
